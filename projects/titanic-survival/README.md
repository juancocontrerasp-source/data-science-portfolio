# Titanic Survival Prediction (EDA + Modeling)

## Goal
Analyze the Titanic dataset to understand which factors influenced passenger survival and build classification models to predict survival.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset (train.csv / test.csv)
- Target variable: `survived`

## Project Structure
- `01_eda.ipynb` → Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- `02_feature_engineering.ipynb` → Data cleaning & preprocessing
- `03_model_advanced.ipynb` → Modeling and evaluation

## Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering (handling missing values & categorical variables)  
4. Model training and evaluation  

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (advanced model)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest achieved strong performance on the test set.
This project demonstrates a full machine learning pipeline using `scikit-learn` pipelines.

## How to Run
Open the notebooks in order from the `notebooks/` folder using Jupyter or VS Code.
